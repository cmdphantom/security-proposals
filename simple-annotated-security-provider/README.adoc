# simple-annotated-security-provider

https://java.net/jira/browse/JAVAEE_SPEC-25

From: Reza Rahman

I think in the bare minimum we need to have something as simple as this:

```
import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.security.auth.OnAuthentication;
import javax.security.auth.OnAuthorization;
import javax.security.auth.SecurityProvider;
import javax.security.auth.UserService;
import java.security.Principal;

@SecurityProvider
public class MySecurityProvider {

    @Inject
    private UserService userService;

    /**
     * The parameters could suit the credentials mechanism being used.
     */
    @OnAuthentication
    public Principal getPrincipal(String username, String password) {
        // Construct the principal using the user service.
        return null;
    }

    @OnAuthorization
    public String[] getRoles(Principal principal) {
        // Construct an array of roles using the principal and user service. }
        return null;
    }
}
```

The exact sematics here is not important, just the general concept. I would hope this could be sorted out in the relevant expert group/groups. I know this is easier said than done. However, if Resin can do it (kind of), it can't be that hard either.
