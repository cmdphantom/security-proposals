This proposal models primarily a mutable identity store with many operations. Most of those operations go far beyond the minimal {credentials in/identity out} that containers themselves call.

The identity store is represented by the IdentityStore interface. There are definition (factory) annotations for various standardized implementations. Usage of these annotations by
applications will cause an IdentityStore implementation to be made available via JNDI.

The {identity out} part of the {credentials in/identity out} function comes from the UserInfo class that is returned by IdentityStore#loadUserByUsername.

The {credentials in} part of the {credentials in/identity out} function is not shown in this proposal.

This proposal also models a role mapper, which largely follows the same pattern as the identity store.

Finally, the proposal seems to model an authentication mechanism (orginally called authenticator). TODO: I'm not 100% if this indeed models an authentication mechanism such as a JASPIC SAM
does.

The IdentityStore annotations would be an adapter between the repository and the IdentityStore interface. We would standardize IdentityStore implementations for various repository types (LDAP, DataSource,
