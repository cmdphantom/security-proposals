= Proposed read-only simplified Identity Store

A somewhat simplified variant of the the "identity-store-read-only" proposal. 

In particular, this proposal omits the persistence and query packages and adds 
"[storeType]Definition" annotations that in analogy to @DataSourceDefinition
are intended to instruct the container to make an implementation of the requested type available.
