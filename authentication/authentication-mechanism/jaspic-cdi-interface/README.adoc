# jaspic-cdi-interface

Proposed early draft of API and example implementation for the authentication mechanism. 

The API lives in javax.security.authentication.mechanism.http
Implementation lives in org.glassfish.jsr375

Main API class is javax.security.authentication.mechanism.http.HttpAuthenticationMechanism.

The concept of this proposal is that a CDI extension detects the presence of an enabled bean that implements HttpAuthenticationMechanism,
and if found installs a JASPIC bridge SAM. This bridge SAM uses CDI to obtain the HttpAuthenticationMechanism instance and delegate its methods
to.

This in effect causes CDI to be fully available in the HttpAuthenticationMechanism, but doesn't require the JASPIC SAM itself to
be a CDI bean.

HttpAuthenticationMechanism is based on the similarly named type from the jaspic-http-sam proposal, but here it's an interface and a type to which
a SAM delegates, but is itself not a SAM.
